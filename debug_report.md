**Problem Defined:**

- **Bug Description:** The UI throws a `TypeError: e.map is not a function` at `http://127.0.0.1:3456/ui/:360:101570`.
- **Impact:** The Mission Control dashboard fails to render, preventing users from accessing real-time monitoring and control features.

**Analysis Process:**

1.  **Initial Investigation:** The error pointed to a minified file, so I began by examining the source code, starting with `Dashboard.tsx` and `dashboard.ts` to understand the overall structure.
2.  **Component Analysis:** I then inspected `OverviewTab.tsx` and `MissionControlTab.tsx`, which led me to the three-column components: `ColumnLeft_RealTimeOps`, `ColumnMiddle_StrategicInsights`, and `ColumnRight_ControlCenter`.
3.  **Widget Inspection:** The investigation narrowed down to the widgets rendered in `ColumnLeft_RealTimeOps.tsx`. I examined `SystemHealthChecker.tsx` and identified that it uses the `useSystemHealthChecker` hook, which returns an `alerts` array that is iterated over with `.map()`.
4.  **Hook Analysis:** The root cause was discovered in `useSystemHealthChecker.ts`. The `SystemHealth` interface defined the `alerts` property at the root level, but the `systemHealthData` object was created with `alerts` outside the `components` object. This mismatch caused `alerts` to be `undefined` when accessed from the `SystemHealthChecker` component.

**Root Cause Identified:**

The `TypeError: e.map is not a function` was caused by a structural mismatch in the `SystemHealth` interface and its implementation in the `useSystemHealthChecker.ts` hook. The `alerts` array was defined outside the `components` object, leading to an `undefined` value when the `SystemHealthChecker` component attempted to map over it.

**Solution Implemented:**

1.  **Moved `alerts`:** The `alerts: SystemAlert[]` property was moved inside the `components` object in the `SystemHealth` interface.
2.  **Updated `systemHealthData`:** The `systemHealthData` object was updated to include `alerts: newAlerts` within the `components` object, ensuring the data structure is consistent.

**Status:** `Resolved`
