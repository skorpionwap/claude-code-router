# 🧹 CLEANUP SCRIPTS - README

## Overview
Acest director conține scripturile pentru curățenia finală după integrarea ExecutionGuard.

## 📁 Available Scripts

### 🧪 `test-cleanup-readiness.sh`
**Purpose:** Verifică că toate componentele sunt pregătite pentru cleanup.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/test-cleanup-readiness.sh
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Project structure (package.json, src/utils, ExecutionGuard.ts)
- ✅ Target files existence (6 files to be deleted)
- ✅ Cleanup scripts existence and permissions
- ✅ Build system functionality
- ✅ Git repository status
- ✅ Old references scan
- ✅ Documentation completeness

**Output:** Pass/Fail status for 22+ tests

---

### 🔧 `prepare-cleanup-imports.sh`
**Purpose:** Actualizează toate import-urile pentru a folosi ExecutionGuard.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/prepare-cleanup-imports.sh
```

**What it does:**
- 🔄 Creates temporary backup
- 🔄 Updates imports in src/index.ts
- 🔄 Updates imports in src/routes/*.ts  
- 🔄 Updates imports in src/utils/provider-fallback.ts
- 🔄 Tests build after changes
- 🔄 Auto-restore if build fails

**Safety:** Automatic rollback on any failure

---

### 🗑️ `cleanup-consolidated-files.sh`
**Purpose:** Șterge fișierele consolidate în ExecutionGuard după testarea completă.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/cleanup-consolidated-files.sh
```

**What it does:**
- 📋 Pre-flight checks (build test, ExecutionGuard exists)
- 💾 Creates complete backup with timestamp  
- 🔍 Final scan for remaining references
- 🗑️ Deletes 6 consolidated files
- 🔨 Final build test
- 📝 Git commit with descriptive message
- 📚 Updates .gitignore

**Safety:** Multiple validation steps and automatic backup

---

### ⚡ `rollback-from-cleanup.sh`
**Purpose:** Emergency restore în caz de probleme după cleanup.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/rollback-from-cleanup.sh /path/to/backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

**What it does:**
- 🔍 Verifies backup completeness
- 💾 Creates safety backup of current state
- ⚡ Restores all files from specified backup
- 🔨 Tests build after restore
- 📝 Creates rollback commit
- 📋 Provides troubleshooting recommendations

**Safety:** Double-backup system (original + safety backup)

---

## 🚨 EXECUTION ORDER

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Execute in this exact order!

```bash
# 1. Test that everything is ready
./scripts/test-cleanup-readiness.sh

# 2. Update imports to use ExecutionGuard  
./scripts/prepare-cleanup-imports.sh

# 3. Delete consolidated files (only after integration is complete!)
./scripts/cleanup-consolidated-files.sh

# 4. Emergency rollback (only if needed)
./scripts/rollback-from-cleanup.sh /path/to/backup-folder
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Multiple Backup Layers:
- **Temp backup** during import updates
- **Complete backup** before file deletion
- **Safety backup** before emergency rollback
- **Timestamped backups** for easy identification

### Build Validation:
- **Pre-flight build test** 
- **Post-import build test**
- **Final build test**
- **Post-rollback build test**

### Auto-Recovery:
- **Automatic rollback** on any build failure
- **Preservation of working state** at all times
- **Git commit safety** with descriptive messages

## 📊 Files Targeted for Cleanup

### Will be DELETED (6 files):
```
src/utils/request-deduplication.ts      → Consolidated in ExecutionGuard
src/utils/ai-request-controller.ts      → Consolidated in ExecutionGuard  
src/utils/request-queue.ts              → Consolidated in ExecutionGuard
src/utils/provider-fallback.ts          → Consolidated in ExecutionGuard
src/utils/fetch-interceptor.ts          → Consolidated in ExecutionGuard
src/utils/rate-limiter.ts               → Consolidated in ExecutionGuard
```

### Will be MODIFIED (6+ files):
```
src/index.ts                           → Updated imports
src/routes/strategy.ts                 → Updated imports
src/routes/optimization.ts             → Updated imports 
src/routes/advanced-system.ts          → Updated imports
src/routes/request-optimization.ts     → Updated imports
(+other files with references)
```

### Will be PRESERVED:
```
src/utils/ExecutionGuard.ts            → Single traffic control system
src/utils/analytics.ts                 → Separate concern
src/utils/cache.ts                     → Separate concern
src/utils/router.ts                    → Separate concern
(+all other files)
```

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

Before running cleanup scripts:

1. ✅ **ExecutionGuard integration is 100% complete**
2. ✅ **qa-test-engineer confirmed all tests pass**  
3. ✅ **performance-engineer confirmed performance is OK**
4. ✅ **Application runs perfectly with ExecutionGuard**
5. ✅ **No broken references in code**

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails:
```bash
# Check what failed:
npm run build 2>&1 | grep -i error

# If imports are missing, run preparation again:
./scripts/prepare-cleanup-imports.sh
```

### References Still Found:
```bash
# Find remaining references:
grep -r "request-deduplication\|ai-request-controller" src/

# Update those files manually, then re-run cleanup
```

### Need Emergency Rollback:
```bash
# Find your backup:
ls -la | grep backup-

# Restore (replace with actual backup path):
./scripts/rollback-from-cleanup.sh backup-20250826-093045
```

## 🎯 Expected Final State

After successful cleanup:
- **ExecutionGuard.ts** = single source of truth for traffic control
- **6 duplicate files removed** from src/utils/
- **All imports updated** to use ExecutionGuard
- **Build working** and all tests passing
- **Git history clean** with descriptive commits
- **Backup available** for emergency restore if needed

**🚀 Result:** Cleaner codebase with consolidated traffic control system!
