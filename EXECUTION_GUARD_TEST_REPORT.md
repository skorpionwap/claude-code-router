## üêõ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### #BUG-001: Deduplication Exclude Endpoints Not Working
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Component:** Deduplication System  
**Description:** Requests to endpoints listed in `excludeEndpoints` configuration are still being cached when they should be excluded.

**Evidence:**
```
Analytics endpoints excluded from caching (0ms vs 0ms)
Issue: Analytics request was cached when it should be excluded
```

**Root Cause:** The `checkDeduplication` function logic for filtering exclude endpoints is not working correctly.

**Impact:** Analytics and monitoring endpoints may return cached data instead of fresh data, leading to stale metrics.

**Recommended Fix:** Review and fix the endpoint exclusion logic in `checkDeduplication()` method.

---

### #BUG-002: Rate Limiting Burst Protection Not Enforced
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Component:** Rate Limiting System  
**Description:** Burst protection limits are not being properly enforced, allowing more requests than configured.

**Evidence:**
```
Burst protection
Issue: Burst limit was not enforced

Per-minute limit enforcement (8/8 requests succeeded)
Issue: Per-minute limit was not enforced
```

**Root Cause:** Rate limiting logic has issues with burst detection and session tracking.

**Impact:** System vulnerable to request flooding and API cost overruns.

**Recommended Fix:** Debug and fix the rate limiting logic in `checkRateLimit()` method, especially burst window calculations.

---

### #BUG-003: Circuit Breaker Not Blocking Requests in OPEN State
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Component:** Circuit Breaker System  
**Description:** When circuit breaker is in OPEN state, it should block all requests but some are still getting through.

**Evidence:**
```
Circuit breaker blocking
Issue: Request was not blocked by open circuit breaker
```

**Root Cause:** Circuit breaker state checking logic has a race condition or timing issue.

**Impact:** System continues to make failing requests even when circuit breaker should protect it.

**Recommended Fix:** Review the circuit breaker state management and request blocking logic.
