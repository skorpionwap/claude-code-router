# Deployment Strategy for Widget Transformation Project

## 1. Production Build Process

To prepare the project for a production environment, the following steps must be executed to build both the backend and frontend components.

1.  **Navigate to Project Root:** Ensure you are in the `/opt/lampp/htdocs/claude-code-router` directory.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to ensure all required project dependencies are installed.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Build Project:** Execute the `npm run build` command. This script is configured to compile and optimize both the backend (TypeScript) and frontend (React/TypeScript) code for production.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command will generate the optimized production-ready artifacts, typically in a `dist` or `build` directory, ready for deployment.

## 2. Canary Rollout Strategy

A phased canary rollout strategy will be employed to ensure a smooth and stable release of the new widget functionalities. This approach allows for gradual exposure to the new features while closely monitoring key metrics.

**Rollout Phases:**

*   **Phase 1: Internal Testing (5% of users)**
    *   **Target Audience:** Internal development team, QA, and a small group of alpha testers.
    *   **Duration:** 1-2 days.
    *   **Purpose:** To catch any critical issues that might have been missed during staging and gather initial feedback from a controlled group.

*   **Phase 2: Early Adopters (20% of users)**
    *   **Target Audience:** Opt-in beta users or a randomly selected segment of early adopters.
    *   **Duration:** 3-5 days.
    *   **Purpose:** To validate performance, stability, and user experience in a slightly broader real-world scenario.

*   **Phase 3: Broader Release (50% of users)**
    *   **Target Audience:** A larger, randomly selected segment of the user base.
    *   **Duration:** 5-7 days.
    *   **Purpose:** To observe behavior and performance under increased load and diverse user interactions.

*   **Phase 4: Full Rollout (100% of users)**
    *   **Target Audience:** All users.
    *   **Duration:** Ongoing monitoring.
    *   **Purpose:** Complete deployment after successful validation in previous phases.

**Metrics to Monitor During Canary Rollout:**

The following metrics, referenced from the 'Success Metrics' section of the project plan (`/opt/lampp/htdocs/claude-code-router/docs/plans/WIDGET_TRANSFORM_PLAN.md`), will be continuously monitored:

*   **User Engagement:**
    *   **Metric:** Time spent on the dashboard.
    *   **Target:** +30% time spent on the dashboard.
*   **Button Click Rate:**
    *   **Metric:** Click-through rate on new interactive elements within the widgets.
    *   **Target:** +50% compared to the old version.
*   **Task Completion Rate:**
    *   **Metric:** Success rate for optimization actions initiated via the widgets.
    *   **Target:** +40% for optimization actions.
*   **Support Tickets:**
    *   **Metric:** Volume of support tickets related to widget functionality, especially "how-to" queries.
    *   **Target:** -25% for "how to do X" tickets.
*   **System Understanding:**
    *   **Metric:** User satisfaction related to understanding the system's status and recommendations.
    *   **Target:** +60% user satisfaction (measured via surveys).
*   **Performance Benchmarks:**
    *   **Loading Time:** Dashboard loading time. **Target:** <3s.
    *   **API Response:** Response time for new widget-related API calls. **Target:** <1s.
    *   **Memory Usage:** Memory consumption per widget. **Target:** <100MB per widget.
    *   **Bundle Size:** Size of the new code bundle. **Target:** <500KB.

Any significant deviation from these targets or an increase in error rates will trigger an immediate review and potential rollback.

## 3. Post-Deployment Monitoring Plan

After the full rollout, continuous monitoring of the application's health and the success of the new widgets is crucial. The following KPIs will be rigorously tracked:

*   **Real-time Monitoring:**
    *   **System Health Checker Widget:** Continuously monitor the `System Health Checker` widget for overall system status and auto-fix suggestions.
    *   **Performance Alert Widget:** Actively monitor the `Performance Alert` widget for any critical, warning, or informational alerts.
    *   **Route Monitor Widget:** Track request patterns, model usage, and override detections using the `Route Monitor` to ensure traffic flows as expected.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    *   **User Engagement:** Utilize analytics tracking tools to measure the average time users spend on the dashboard and their interaction frequency with the new widgets.
    *   **Feature Adoption:** Monitor the usage rates of new widget functionalities, particularly interactive elements like "Apply All" in Cost Optimizer or "Resolve Automatically" in Performance Alert.
    *   **Conversion Rates:** For optimization-related widgets (e.g., `Cost Optimizer`), track the rate at which users apply recommended changes.
    *   **Support & Feedback:** Continuously monitor support channels for user queries, bug reports, and general feedback related to the new widgets. A significant increase in "how-to" questions might indicate a UX issue.
*   **Technical Performance:**
    *   **Dashboard Loading Times:** Monitor the end-to-end loading time of the dashboard to ensure it remains below the 3-second benchmark.
    *   **API Response Times:** Track the latency of all new API endpoints (`/api/v1/routes/usage`, `/api/v1/cost/optimizations`, etc.) to ensure they meet the <1s target.
    *   **Error Rates:** Monitor server-side and client-side error rates for all widget-related functionalities. Set up alerts for any unusual spikes.
    *   **Resource Utilization:** Monitor server CPU, memory, and network I/O to identify any performance bottlenecks introduced by the new features.
*   **Cost & Usage Tracking:**
    *   **Cost & Usage Forecast Widget:** Use this widget to proactively monitor current and projected costs against budget.
    *   **Cost Optimizer Widget:** Regularly review cost optimization suggestions and track actual savings achieved.

**Alerting and Reporting:**

*   Automated alerts will be configured for any deviations from the established KPIs, performance benchmarks, or unusual error patterns.
*   Regular reports will be generated, summarizing the performance and success of the widget transformation project, to be reviewed by stakeholders.

## 4. Rollback Plan

A robust rollback plan is essential to quickly mitigate any critical issues that may arise post-deployment. This plan leverages feature flags for rapid version switching.

**Pre-Deployment Preparations:**

1.  **Feature Flag Implementation:** The new widgets have been implemented behind a feature flag. This allows for immediate toggling between the old and new versions without requiring a full redeployment.
2.  **Version Tagging:** Ensure that the production build is meticulously tagged in the version control system (e.g., Git) to facilitate quick identification of the last stable version.
3.  **Automated Rollback Scripts:** Develop and test automated scripts that can quickly revert the feature flag state or, if necessary, deploy the previous stable version of the application.

**Rollback Procedure:**

1.  **Issue Identification:**
    *   Critical issues are defined as: complete service outages, severe performance degradation (e.g., dashboard loading times exceeding 10 seconds, API response times consistently above 5 seconds), high error rates (e.g., >5% for critical functionalities), or data corruption.
    *   Issues will be identified through automated monitoring alerts, user reports, or internal testing.
2.  **Trigger Rollback:**
    *   Upon confirmed detection of a critical issue, the rollback process will be immediately triggered by the DevOps team lead or designated incident commander.
3.  **Revert Feature Flag (Primary Method):**
    *   The primary rollback mechanism involves disabling the feature flag for the new widgets. This will immediately serve the old widget versions to all users.
    *   This action is a near-instantaneous change and does not require a code deployment.
    *   Example command (conceptual): `ccr set-feature-flag --feature=newWidgets --status=disabled`
4.  **Redeploy Previous Version (Secondary Method - If Feature Flag Fails):**
    *   If the feature flag mechanism is compromised or insufficient to resolve the issue, the last known stable version of the application (identified by its Git tag) will be deployed.
    *   This involves deploying the previous successful build artifacts.
    *   Example steps (conceptual):
        ```bash
        git checkout <last_stable_commit_hash>
        npm run build
        # Deploy build artifacts to production environment
        ```
5.  **Monitor Rollback Success:**
    *   Immediately after executing the rollback (either via feature flag or redeployment), continuously monitor the system's health, performance, and error rates to confirm stability has been restored.
6.  **Post-Mortem Analysis:**
    *   After the system has stabilized, a thorough post-mortem analysis will be conducted. This includes:
        *   Identifying the root cause of the critical issue.
        *   Reviewing the monitoring data leading up to the incident.
        *   Analyzing the effectiveness of the rollback procedure.
        *   Implementing corrective and preventive measures to avoid recurrence.
        *   Updating documentation and training if necessary.

This comprehensive deployment strategy aims to ensure a smooth transition to the new widget functionalities while minimizing risks and providing clear recovery paths.
